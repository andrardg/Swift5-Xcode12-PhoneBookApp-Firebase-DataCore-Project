# Swift5-Xcode12-PhoneBookApp-Firebase-DataCore-Project
This project is a phonebook application, where you can keep your contacts.
It requires you to Sign In via email or Google (Firebase).
The flow of the projet is given by a UINavigationController.
There is a background song in the project, implemented with AVAudioPlayer.
The contacts are stored in DataCore and shown in a UITableView. There are CRUD operations implemented for the contacts.
A shaking CABasicAnimation is put in place for when an empty phone number field is entered.
Contact photos can be chosen from the gallery and they are uploaded to Firebase.
A contact can be called. Therefore, when the call button is pressed, a local notification appears and the call is added to DataCore. All the call are shown in a UICollectionView.
A contact can also be shared to the local applications (UIActivityViewController).
The entire project has the UI adapted for landscape mode.
